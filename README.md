# roads-representation
This is an experiment in defining a bi-directional representation handler


The ideal end result of this class would be a single representation definition that would allow me to pass user input and save it to the database, or pass database input and send it to the user.

This should simplify the amount of code required to build an API and help enforce a powerful API design strategy of field consistency.
